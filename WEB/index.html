    <h2>FOO FIGHTERS 어떤데.</h2>
    <img width="60%" src="essentials.jpg">
    <p style="margin-top:40px;"><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Fighters" target="_blank" title="foo fighters wikipedia">Foo Fighters</a></strong> is an American rock band formed in Seattle in 1994. Founded as a one-man project by the former Nirvana drummer <u>Dave Grohl</u>, the lineup now consists of Grohl (lead vocals, guitar), Nate Mendel (bass), Chris Shiflett and Pat Smear (guitars), Rami Jaffee (keyboards), and Josh Freese (drums).</p>
    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Grohl created Foo Fighters after the breakup of Nirvana in 1994 to release solo material. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 eponymous debut album, he recruited Mendel and William Goldsmith (drums), both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, and Smear, who had played with Nirvana on tour. The band made their first public performance in February 1995. Goldsmith quit during the recording of their second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997). Most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl. Smear departed soon afterward.</p>
