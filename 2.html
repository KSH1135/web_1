    <p>Grohl created Foo Fighters after the breakup of Nirvana in 1994 to release solo material. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 eponymous debut album, he recruited Mendel and William Goldsmith (drums), both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, and Smear, who had played with Nirvana on tour. The band made their first public performance in February 1995. Goldsmith quit during the recording of their second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997). Most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl. Smear departed soon afterward.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Smear and Goldsmith were replaced by Franz Stahl (guitar) and Taylor Hawkins (drums). Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Shiflett joined after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose, solidifying the core of their lineup.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Concrete and Gold (2017) was the second Foo Fighters album to reach number one in the United States and the first to feature Jaffee, their longtime session and touring keyboardist, as a full member. Their tenth album, Medicine at Midnight (2021), was the last before Hawkins' death in March 2022. Freese was announced as the band's new drummer the following year.</p>
